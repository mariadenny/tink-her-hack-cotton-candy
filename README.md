### Project Description
The app is designed as a health management tool to assist users. It aims to empower users with features like reminders, trackers, and educational resources while maintaining a user-friendly and accessible interface.

### The Problem statement
Chronic conditions such as diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension require consistent monitoring and management. However, many patients face challenges such as:
1.Forgetting to take medications on time.
2.Difficulty scheduling and keeping track of health checkups.
3.Uncertainty when immediate health-related questions arise.
4.Lack of tools to manage emergencies effectively.
These gaps often lead to complications, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare costs. There’s a need for an easy-to-use, reliable tool to assist users in managing their health.

### The Solution
The app addresses the above problems through the following features:

Core Features:
1.Medicine Reminders: Sends notifications to ensure users take medications on time.
2.Missed Dose Notifications: Alerts immediate contacts if the user misses doses consistently.
3.Health Checkup Reminders: Prompts users to schedule regular medical checkups based on their condition.

Additional Features:
1.Chatbot: Answers basic health-related questions and offers guidance for managing chronic conditions.
2.Guided Meditation
